      "description" : "When Debbie Sterling heard from Steve Jobs at her Stanford graduation that she should \"never settle\" until she found her true passion, she took this to heart. After graduating from Stanford with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and Product Design, she had firsthand knowledge of how significantly men outnumber women in science, technology, engineering and math. Debbie then became obsessed with the notion of \"disrupting the pink aisle\" with a toy that would introduce girls to the joy of engineering at a young age. Industry leaders told her the idea would fail, but less than three years after launching GoldieBlox on Kickstarter, she has made significant strides in her quest to bridge the gender gap in STEM: she has launched massively successful viral videos, a Superbowl ad that brought mainstream awareness to her mission, an award-winning iOS app and GoldieBlox presence in more than 6,000 retail stores worldwide. Debbie has also recently been selected to join the Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship, a select group 'committed to helping develop the next generation of entrepreneurs around the world.' Hear Debbie's story of challenging the status quo, achieving audacious goals, and igniting a national conversation about breaking gender stereotypes.",

His journey led him to build Avaz, a wheelchair-mounted tablet to help people with disabilities communicate, then even more ambitiously, to invent FreeSpeech, an entirely new visual language that could break down language barriers altogether. Ajit will talk about the series of events that led to the creation of the Avaz and FreeSpeech apps, their impact in India and around the world (earning him the National Award for Empowerment of People with Disabilities from the President of India) and his ideas on the transformative role that apps can play in education.",

While not required, we recommend watching \"Introducing SF Symbols\" from WWDC19. If you’re planning to incorporate symbol assets into SwiftUI, you may also benefit from watching “Building Custom Views with SwiftUI.\"",

Discover how people can take advantage of Scribble and handwritten text in apps that use standard text input controls or that implement a custom text editing experience. You’ll learn how it integrates into TextKit, and when you’ll need to adopt the new UIScribbleInteraction and UIIndirectScribbleInteraction APIs to provide a delightful and consistent experience with Scribble in your app.\n\nTo get the most out of this session, you should be familiar with UIKit text input controls, as well as keyboard input technologies. To get started, watch “Keyboard Input in iOS”. If you’re building a custom text editor, you should be familiar with the UITextInput protocol, TextKit, and related text input APIs. For more information, we recommend checking out “TextKit Best Practices” and “The Keys to a Better Text Input Experience.” And for design guidelines on pencil-based interaction, check out “Apple Pencil Design Essentials.”",

For more information, watch \"Delivering Intuitive Media Playback with AVKit.\"\n\nWe can't wait to see how you take advantage of tvOS’s unique Picture in Picture features with AVPlayerViewController.",

In this session, we’ll discuss the efficiency of Apple GPUs and show how TBDR applies to an array of modern rendering techniques.\n\nYou should come to the session with a basic knowledge of Metal and graphics rendering. For a great introduction, check out “Modern Rendering with Metal” to orient yourself.",

      "description" : "iOS and iPadOS provide powerful capabilities to help developers deliver breakthrough apps and games across all device generations. In certain instances, however, demanding apps with exceptional performance requirements may only be able to provide the best experience on devices with an A12 Bionic chip or higher. \n\nWith Xcode 12, developers can now enable a setting for performance-intensive apps and games to indicate this requirement. We’ll walk you through the narrow circumstances for when to apply this setting and the app distribution trade-offs that must be carefully considered. \n\nBefore selecting this approach, you should have deep experience in optimizing your apps. Watch “Delivering Optimized Metal Apps and Games” for specific insights into the tools and best practices you can use to make your product work well on all supported devices.\n\nFor more on creating graphics-intensive experiences for your app or game using Metal, check out “Harness Apple GPUs with Metal”.",

Utilizing the AVFoundation framework, AVQT supports a wide range of video formats, codecs, resolutions and frame-rates in both the SDR and HDR domains, which results in easy and efficient workflows — for example, no requirement to decode to a raw pixel format.\n\nAVQT uses Metal to achieve high processing speeds by offloading heavy pixel-level computation to the GPU, typically analyzing videos in excess of real-time video frame rates. With incredible ease of use and computational efficiency, AVQT can help you eliminate low-quality videos from your video catalog before they might otherwise reach people in your app.",

After having a nationally-televised panic attack in 2004, he found himself on a long and often bizarre journey that ended with him discovering mindfulness meditation. Dan will share his story, which has led to his authoring two books and creating a popular podcast and app that have helped many (including previous non-believers like himself) improve their lives. He will be joined by Jeff Warren, renowned meditation teacher and Dan's co-author of the bestselling book Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics, to offer practical steps that anyone can take to manage the wide-ranging stresses and anxieties of today's world to become 10% happier.",

Find out how to build a fast, end-to-end shader pipeline from DXIL that supports all shader stages and allows you to leverage the advanced features of Apple GPUs. We’ll also show you how to reduce app launch time and stutters by generating GPU binaries with the offline compiler.\n\nTo get the most out of this session, we recommend first watching “Bring your game to Mac, Part 1: Make a game plan.\" And once you’re ready to level up, check out “Bring your game to Mac, Part 2: Render with Metal\" from WWDC23.",
